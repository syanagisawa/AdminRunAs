# AdminRunAs
Run As Like Administrators

## Introduction

AdminRunAs is a simple Windows application that handles allow different users (whether or not administrators) to execute application elevating privileges, similar to the famous sudo command of Unix / Linux operating systems. 

AdminRunAs has a graphical interface which allows you to select the applications that the user can run, posting all these activities for their respective audits.

Its configuration is editing a simple XML file you can define which users will be able to run the applications you want to delegate.

With a more comfortable AdminRunAs functionality using the User Account Control (UAC) in Windows and integrated with fewer constraints is achieved.

## The AdminRusAs philosophy

Like a [SUDO](http://www.sudo.ws), AdminRusAs is a Windows program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited Administrator privileges to users and log this activity.  The basic philosophy is to give as few privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.
