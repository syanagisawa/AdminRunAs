# AdminRunAs

Run As Like Administrators

## The AdminRusAs philosophy

Like a [SUDO](http://www.sudo.ws), AdminRusAs is a Windows program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited Administrator privileges to users and log this activity.  The basic philosophy is to give as few privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.
